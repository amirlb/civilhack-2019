The goal of this project is to supply information on likely future congestion in your path,
allowing you to chose you public transport wisely.

This project was made during `CivilHack 2019 <https://civichack2019.hasadna.org.il/hackathon>`_,
The yearly hackathon of the `Israeli Public Knowledge Workshop <https://www.hasadna.org.il/en/>`_.

|

The source code is available `here <https://github.com/amirlb/civilhack-2019>`_.

|

Please understand that this is a hackathon project and thus not very well documented.
In each module you can press the "Source" button to view the source code
easily from within the documentation site.

Hope you enjoy, and keep contributing to the public knowledge :)
